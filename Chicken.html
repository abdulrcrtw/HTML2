            HISTORY
        </b>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Born in the village of Ibogun-Olaogun to a farming family of the Owu branch of the Yoruba,
        Obasanjo was educated largely in Abeokuta, Ogun State.
        He joined the Nigerian Army and specialised in engineering and was assigned to the Congo,
        Britain,
        and India,
        rising to the rank of major.
        In the late 1960s,
        he played a senior role in combating Biafran separatists during the Nigerian Civil War,
        accepting their surrender in 1970.
        In 1975, a military coup established a junta with Obasanjo as part of its ruling triumvirate.
        After the triumvirate's leader, Murtala Muhammed, was assassinated the following year,
        the Supreme Military Council appointed Obasanjo as head of state.

        In 1993, Sani Abacha seized power in a military coup.
        Obasanjo was openly critical of Abacha's administration and in 1995 was arrested and convicted of being part of
        a planned coup,
        despite protesting his innocence.
        While imprisoned, he became a born again Christian, with providentialism strongly influencing his subsequent
        worldview.
        He was released following Abacha's death in 1998.
        Obasanjo entered electoral politics, becoming the PDP candidate for the 1999 presidential election which he won.
