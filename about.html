    Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu GCFR (born 29 March 1952) is a Nigerian politician who has served the 16th president of Nigeria since 2023.
    He was previously the governor of Lagos State from 1999 to 2007, and senator for Lagos West in the Third Republic.
    Tinubu spent his early life in southwestern Nigeria and later moved to the United States where he studied accounting at Chicago State University. 
    He returned to Nigeria in the early 1990s and was employed by Mobil Nigeria as an accountant, 
    before entering politics as a Lagos West senatorial candidate in 1992 under the banner of the Social Democratic Party. 
    After the military head of state Sani Abacha dissolved the Senate in 1993, 
    Tinubu became an activist campaigning for the return of democracy as a part of the National Democratic Coalition movement.
